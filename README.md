# APS - _Face recognize_

This project was developed for work at the UNIP faculty, Supervised Practical Activities "APS".

 - `JavaScript`
 - `HTML5`
 - `CSS3`

## Libs

The Project uses several open source projects to work correctly:

- `Face-API` - Used for face recognition 
- `jQuery` - Used to create agile functions 

## Installation

Just put this project on some live server and it will work.

> Don't try to run just HTML as it makes some requests in api, so it won't work
